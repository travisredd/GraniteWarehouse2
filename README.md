# Granite1-Summer2018

I ran into a few problems. I the first problem I ran into was the object reference error that I emailed you about. It was concerning specifically the line var count = HttpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Session.Get<List<int>>("ssShoppingCart").Count; That was after watching the first 2 videos and I watched them over and over to try and find the problem as well as using the debugger. I couldn't find that solution.
